Hi everyone, my name is **Raffaele Carelle** I've 30 years old and I live in Sacile (PN) Italy. My hobbies are listen music, watching films and tv series, read,
and of course, technology.

I've started on develop Web Application many yeas ago, and since then I have not stopped. Since two years I develop with **Symfony framework** and I like so much.
Now I work with *OROCOMMERCE/OROCRM/OROPLATFORM* tools, which are developed in Symfony and they are very useful to build awesome **e-commerce platforms**!

The company I work for is **ALGORITMA**, a innovative *Software house / Web agency* located in a beautiful city called Oderzo (TV).

I love this work, because my team is the best and the projects that we are working on are big and satisfying. 

I also work on various **open-source PHP projects**, recently for example, I've contributed to translate the new *Symfony book "The fast track"*.

This is me, and if you want to say "hi" on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter social" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tweeter</a>
